            <h3>Hello, my name is Igor and I am a web developer in Atlanta, Georgia.</h3>
            <p>I am from Atlanta, GA and I am currently attending the DigitalCrafts Immersive Web Development bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>DigitalCrafts is a top-rated coding bootcamp teaching the fundamentals of programming through an
                intensive classroom experience, transforming beginners into full-stack software engineers with
                cutting-edge skill sets.
            </p>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in the Immersive Web Development course that covers Python, HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript, including an emphasis on cutting-edge frameworks like React/Redux and server side
                technologies including Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. </p>
            <p> In my freetime I enjoy mountain biking and playing soccer.</p>

                <h2>Projects:</h2>
                <h3 class="project-header">DigitalCrafts Project Database
                    <a class="fab fa-github project-info-link" href="https://github.com/iggz/DCPD" target="_blank"></a>
                    <a class="fas fa-external-link-alt project-info-link"

                </h3>
                <p>The DigitalCrafts Project Database is a full-stack project for DigitalCrafts built with Node,
                    Express, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and ES6 Renderer. It was built with a team of 3 over the
                    course of 3 days in class. We built the DCPD to be a solution to a problem that many bootcamp
                    students have: finding inspiration (or help) when building projects. Any DigitalCrafts student or
                    alumni can submit a project to the database (via Slack authentication), and the database is viewable
                    to everyone. </p>

                </h3>
                <p>CrytpoLogic is a front-end only application written in vanilla Javascript that utilizes APIs to bring
                    together the multitudinous
                    array of cryptocurrencies under a single domain. The application itself is essentially a dashboard,
                    displaying surface-level information on each currency in real time, sorted by market capitalization.
                    If any particular coin is clicked, a graphical representation of the prior weekâ€™s price change is
                    rendered. The overall goal of the site is to provide the user with the necessary tools to make an
                    informed decision regarding their cryptocurrency assets.</p>

                <h3>Spaghetti Man

                </h3>
                <p>Spaghetti Man is a game written in Python 3 using pygame (the library), which is a Free and Open
                    Source python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games built on
                    top of the excellent SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. In my game, the main character named
                    Spaghetti Man is able to move around on the sceen and throw meatballs at his enemies in order to
                    neutralize them. The enemies include zombies that run and walk, flying pizza cats, and
                    tiny missiles, all of which cause damage to him when they collide.
